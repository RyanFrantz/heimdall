# Heimdall

Heimdall aims to be a comprehensive account management tool that simplifies
managing and auditing users and group across various services.

Imagine on-boarding a new employee that needs a local LDAP account, an AWS
account, and access to some internal service. Heimdall can conceptually ease
administration of all accounts.

## Plugins

Heimdall's functionality is exposed via plugins. Current plugins include:

* Chef
* LDAP

## Who was Heimdall?

In Norse mythology [Heimdall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr) was
responsible for keeping watch at the Bifröst between Earth and Asgard. He
is portrayed as knowing and seeing all souls.

# NOTE

Heimdall is not production-ready. It is currently under development as a
read-only service while several designs and ideas are being tested.
